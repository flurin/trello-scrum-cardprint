## Card format

To get a nice output for cards (see below) write card titles in the following format (all fields are optional).

`(STORYPOINTS) [CLIENT] Rest of the title`

Other supported (native) Trello fields are:

* The card body of course (markdown is not supported)
* Card checklists (works best with just one list)
* Due date

This is an example output for a card generated by TrelloScrum
